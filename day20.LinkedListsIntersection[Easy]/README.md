Given two singly linked lists that __intersect__ at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are _non-cyclical__.

For example, given `A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10` and `B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10`, return the node with value __8__.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in `O(M + N)` time (where __M__ and __N__ are the lengths of the lists) and `constant space`.
