A builder is looking to build a row of _N_ houses that can be of _K_ different colors. He has a goal of _minimizing_ cost while ensuring that _no two_ neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an __N__ by __K__ _matrix_ where the _n_-th row and _k_-th column represents the cost to build the _n_-th house with _k_-th color, return the __minimum cost__ which achieves this goal.
