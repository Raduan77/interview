Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string __de__ and the set of strings `[dog, deer, deal]`, return `[deer, deal]`.

Hint: Try preprocessing the _dictionary_ into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
