There exists a staircase with _N_ steps, and you can climb up either _1_ or _2_ steps at a time. Given _N_, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps __matters__.

For example, if _N_ is __4__, then there are __5__ unique ways:

`1, 1, 1, 1`
`2, 1, 1`
`1, 2, 1`
`1, 1, 2`
`2, 2`
What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if `X = {1, 3, 5}`, you could climb _1_, _3_, or _5_ steps at a time.
