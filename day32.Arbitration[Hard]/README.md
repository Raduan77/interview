Suppose you are given a `table of currency exchange rates`, represented as a *2D array*. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount _A_ of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than _A_ of that currency.

_There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities._
