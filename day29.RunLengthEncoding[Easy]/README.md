Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string `"AAAABBBCCDAA"` would be encoded as `"4A3B2C1D2A"`.

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. _You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters_. _You can assume the string to be decoded is valid_.
