Given an array of numbers, find the _maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array_.

For example, given the array `[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]`, the maximum sum would be *137*, since we would take elements _42, 14, -5, and 86_.

Given the array `[-5, -1, -8, -9]`, the maximum sum would be *0*, since we would not take any elements.

Do this in `O(N)` time.
