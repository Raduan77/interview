Given _pre-order_ and _in-order_ traversals of a binary tree, write a function to reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the following _pre-order_ traversal:

`[a, b, d, e, c, f, g]`

And the following _in-order_ traversal:

`[d, b, e, a, f, c, g]`

You should return the following tree:
```python
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \ / \
d  e f  g
```
