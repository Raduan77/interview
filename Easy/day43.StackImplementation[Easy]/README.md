Implement a *stack* that has the following methods:

- `push(val)`, which pushes an element onto the stack
- `pop()`, which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
- `max()`, which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
<br>
Each method should run in *constant time*.
