Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in _chronological order_, write a function that calculates the *maximum profit* you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given `[9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]`, you should return `5`, since you could buy the stock at _5 dollars_ and sell it at _10 dollars_.
