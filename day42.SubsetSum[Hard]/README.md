Given a list of integers _S_ and a target number _k_, write a function that returns a _subset of S_ that adds up to _k_. If such a subset cannot be made, then return *null*.

Integers can appear _more than once_ in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are _positive_.

For example, given `S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2]` and `k = 24`, return `[12, 9, 2, 1]` since it sums up to 24.
