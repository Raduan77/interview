Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be __0__ or __negative__.

For example, `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return __13__, since we pick __2__, __6__, and __5__. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return __10__, since we pick __5__ and __5__.

Follow-up: Can you do this in `O(N)` time and `constant space`?
