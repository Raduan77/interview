# Interview problems
# Welcome to Interview problems repository!
Here we will post solutions to different problems, sent by [daily coding problems](dailycodingproblems.com)
# How to contribute
If you want to add your solution to the problem or fix existing solution somehow, feel free to-do it.
But firstly, be aware, that you've done all things from this little check-list:
- add solution to a new directory with named as your github username
- pls run all tests from test directory. More about tests will be in each problem README
- if you want to add solution on a new language, use [this](https://gitignore.io) amazing website to append new files to gitignore.
Here is how to do it with curl for python:
`curl https://gitignore.io/api/python > .gitignore`
### If you are not 100% sure in your solution, feel free to do a PR and we will do some Code Review ;)
### Pls do not post the same solution on the same language. Firstly, check-out already existing solutions on your language.
